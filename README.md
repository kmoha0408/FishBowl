# Virtual Fish Bowl!

A shiny app for the incredibly fun game called Fish Bowl. This was a fun project to do while stuck at home during COVID-19 panademic but also, my first attempt buliding a Shiny App. It's not perfect but enough to have hours of fun with friends. It is publically available through [Shiny APPS IO](https://www.shinyapps.io) at my web link https://kmoha.shinyapps.io/fishbowl/. Feel free to make suggestions to improve it as I always love learning new and creative ideas. 

Since this was my first Shiny APP, I will credit some of my ideas and coding structure that I used in this Shiny APP came from my friend, Connor Jo Lewis from her similar APP called [BOWLS!](https://github.com/connorlewis/bowls-app). You can visit her GitHub site to see her version as well.

As a side note, I am using a free version of Shiny IO so I only have 25 free hours per month to use it. Feel free to view it but please try to limit your time on it. Thanks and have fun!

## How to Set Up the Game
1. Divide into two teams.
2. Write your own 8 clues to add to the Fishbowl by clicking the Setup Tab.

The clues can literally be anything!

## How to Play

When it's your turn
1. Stand in front of your video so your team can see and hear you
2. You will have 1 minute to give your team as many clues to guess the word/phrase.

4. If you don't know the word, press 'Pass' to skip the word.
